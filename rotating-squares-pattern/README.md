# Rotating Squares Pattern with Python Turtle

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a captivating pattern of rotating squares. Each square is rotated slightly from the previous one, creating a spiral-like effect. After a certain number of rotations, the turtle moves outward and starts another series of squares, creating layers of spirals. This project demonstrates the power of loops, conditional statements, and the Turtle graphics library in creating intricate designs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your computer to run this script. This project was developed using Python 3.8, but it should work with most Python 3.x versions. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

No external libraries are required, as the script uses the Turtle graphics library, which is included with Python.

### Running the Script

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL.

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change your directory to the location where you cloned the repository.

   ```
   cd rotating-squares-pattern
   ```

3. **Execute the Script:**

   Run the script using Python.

   ```
   python rotating_squares.py
   ```

## How It Works

The script sets up a Turtle object and a drawing screen with a black background. The pen color is set to white for contrast. The Turtle moves in a pattern, drawing squares and rotating slightly after each square to create a spiral effect. This continues, with the Turtle moving outward and starting new layers of spirals until the pattern completes. The speed of the Turtle is set to the maximum to enhance drawing efficiency.

## Customization

Feel free to experiment with different values in the script to change the pattern's appearance. Adjusting the size of the squares, the degree of rotation, and the number of layers can produce various interesting effects.
