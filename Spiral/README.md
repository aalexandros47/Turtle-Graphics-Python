# Python Turtle Spiral

This project uses the Python `turtle` module to create a captivating spiral pattern. By adjusting the pen and background colors, as well as manipulating the drawing speed and direction, we generate a unique and visually appealing design. This project is an excellent example of how simple mathematical concepts can translate into beautiful digital art.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run this project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you run this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project was developed with Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with most Python 3.x versions. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

This project uses the built-in `turtle` graphics library, so no additional installations are required.

### Running the Script

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL.
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   Change directory to the cloned repository.
   ```
   cd python-turtle-spiral
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   Execute the Python script with Python3.
   ```
   python3 spiral.py
   ```

## How It Works

The script initializes the turtle and screen settings, setting the background to black and the pen color to red. The turtle speed is set to its maximum to expedite the drawing process. 

The spiral is created by continuously moving the turtle forward and gradually increasing its turning angle. This process continues until a predefined condition is met (in this case, when the turning angle reaches 210 degrees), at which point the script terminates the drawing loop and completes the execution.

## Customization

Feel free to experiment with different values of `a` (step increase) and `b` (angle increase) to see how it affects the pattern. Additionally, you can change the background and pen colors to customize the appearance of the spiral.
